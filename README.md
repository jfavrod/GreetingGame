The Greeting Game
=================

In the world, we find at least three common greeting gestures:
    * Bowing (lowering the rorso)
    * Kissing (one, two, or in some cultures 3 cheek kisses)
    * Handshaking

In the greeting game, each Agent greets in one of these three ways.
They also have some degree of klout, and are connected to one or more
other agents.
