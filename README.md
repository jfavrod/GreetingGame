The Greeting Game
=================

In the world, we find at least three common greeting gestures:
* Bowing (lowering the torso)
* Kissing (one, two, or in some cultures three cheek kisses)
* Handshaking

In the greeting game, each Agent _greets_ in one of these three ways.
They also have some degree of klout, and are connected to one or more
other agents.
